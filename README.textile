Android for Maven Eclipse (*m2e-android*) is a "Maven Eclipse":http://www.eclipse.org/m2e/ (m2e) plug-in that adds Maven support for "Android Developer Tools":http://developer.android.com/tools/sdk/eclipse-adt.html (ADT) and the "Maven Android Plugin":https://code.google.com/p/maven-android-plugin/. It brings the power of Maven dependency management into the ADT.

For instructions on how to get started using the m2e-android please see the "project web site.":http://rgladwell.github.com/m2e-android/

h2. Hacking

This section details how to set-up your environment to make code changes to the *m2e-android* code base.

h3. 1. Getting Started

In addition to having Eclipse Juno installed, you need to do the following steps:

# Install the "Android SDK.":http://developer.android.com/sdk/index.html
# Create ANDROID_HOME environment variable containing the Android SDK install path. 
# Ensure you have the latest update on the Android SDK (execute @android update sdk --no-ui --obsolete --force@) 
# Install the "Maven Android SDK Deployer":https://github.com/mosabua/maven-android-sdk-deployer
# Install latest "Android Development Tools.":http://developer.android.com/sdk/eclipse-adt.html
# Install "Eclipse Plug-in Development Environment.":http://www.eclipse.org/pde/
# Install "M2E Plugin 1.2+.":http://www.eclipse.org/m2e/download/
# Install "Maven 3":http://maven.apache.org/download.html for command line "Tycho":http://tycho.sonatype.org/ support.
# Install "Egit":http://www.eclipse.org/egit/download/.
# In Eclipse select Help -> Install new software... and go to the m2eclipse update site.
# Un-check the "Group items by category" check box.
# You should now see the "m2e - Extensions Development Support (Optional)" plugin.
# Select, install and restart Eclipse.

h3. 2. Import Projects

The m2e-android project is made up of six sub-modules: the parent POM project, the core plugin, a test suite, an Android tools plugin, the feature project and an update site project.

To clone them into your Eclipse workspace follow these steps: 

# Clone this git repository into your local workspace.
# In Eclipse select _File_ -> _Import..._ in the menu and then select _Maven_ -> _Existing Maven Projects_.
# Choose the parent folder you just cloned into your workspace (should be _m2e-android_), select all sub projects and click _Finish_
# If you get a "Plugin exception not covered by lifecycle configuration" error in your POM click "Discover new m2e connectors" which should allow you to install the Tycho configurator.
# Mark all new projects in the _Package Explorer_ and right-click on them to select _Team_ -> _Share Project_.
# Select _Git_ and click _Next_.
# Check the _Use or create Repository in parent folder of project_ and click _Finish_.

h3. Patrons

Special thanks to those who crowdfunded project development through "Patreon":http://www.patreon.com/rgladwell:

h3. Travis

The m2e-android project uses "Travis":http://travis-ci.org/ to continuously
integrate its code. To help diagnose issues with Travis, we have added a
"Vagrant":http://www.vagrantup.com/ image and provisioning script that
simulates a Travis CI build.

To use this please follow these steps:

# Install "Vagrant":http://www.vagrantup.com/downloads.html.
# Execute @vagrant up@.

You can then get screenshots by logging into a stalling insatnce as follows:

@$ vagrant ssh@
@$ sudo apt-get install imagemagick@
@$ cd /vagrant@
@$ import -display :99 -window root screenshot.png@
