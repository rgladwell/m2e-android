h2. Hacking

This section details how to set-up your environment to make code changes to the *Android Configurator* code base.

h3. 1. Getting Started

In addition to having Eclipse Juno installed, you need to do the following steps:

# Install the "Android SDK.":http://developer.android.com/sdk/index.html
# Create ANDROID_HOME environment variable containing the Android SDK install path. 
# Ensure you have the latest update on the Android SDK (execute @android update sdk --no-ui --obsolete --force@) 
# Install latest "Android Development Tools.":http://developer.android.com/sdk/eclipse-adt.html
# Install "Eclipse Plug-in Development Environment.":http://www.eclipse.org/pde/
# Install "M2E Plugin 1.2+.":http://www.eclipse.org/m2e/download/
# Install "Maven 3":http://maven.apache.org/download.html for command line "Tycho":http://tycho.sonatype.org/ support.
# Install "Egit":http://www.eclipse.org/egit/download/.
# In Eclipse select Help -> Install new software... and go to the m2eclipse update site.
# Un-check the "Group items by category" check box.
# You should now see the "m2e - Extensions Development Support (Optional)" plugin.
# Select, install and restart Eclipse.

h3. 2. Import Projects

The m2e-android project is made up of six sub-modules: the parent POM project, the core plugin, a test suite, an Android tools plugin, the feature project and an update site project.

To clone them into your Eclipse workspace follow these steps: 

# Clone this git repository into your local workspace.
# In Eclipse select _File_ -> _Import..._ in the menu and then select _Maven_ -> _Existing Maven Projects_.
# Choose the parent folder you just cloned into your workspace (should be _m2e-android_), select all sub projects and click _Finish_
# If you get a "Plugin exception not covered by lifecycle configuration" error in your POM click "Discover new m2e connectors" which should allow you to install the Tycho configurator.
# Mark all new projects in the _Package Explorer_ and right-click on them to select _Team_ -> _Share Project_.
# Select _Git_ and click _Next_.
# Check the _Use or create Repository in parent folder of project_ and click _Finish_.
